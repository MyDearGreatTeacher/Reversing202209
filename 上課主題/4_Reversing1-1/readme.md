## Static binary/Malware  analysis
- Static application security testing (SAST) is a testing process that looks at the application from the inside out.
- This test process is performed without executing the program, but rather by examining the source code, byte code or application binaries for signs of security vulnerabilities.
- In the static test process, the application data and control paths are modeled and then analyzed for security weaknesses.
- Static analysis is a test of the internal structure of the application, rather than functional testing. 

## Dynamic binary/Malware analysis

- Dynamic analysis adopts the opposite approach and is executed while a program is in operation. 
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST) looks at the application from the outside in — by examining it in its running state and trying to manipulate it in order to discover security vulnerabilities.
- The dynamic test simulates attacks against a web application and analyzes the application’s reactions, determining whether it is vulnerable.
